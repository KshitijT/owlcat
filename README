Installing Owlcat
-----------------

1. Prerequisites

* Assorted python packages: pyfits, numpy, matplotlib. These are already
present in most Linux distros.

* casacore and pyrap. Easiest to install these from the MeqTrees repository,
if you have a supported distro (see http://www.astron.nl/meqwiki/Downloading).

2. Getting Owlcat

  svn co svn://lofar9.astron.nl/var/svn/repos/trunk/Owlcat

  This retrieves the latest version from svn. If the need arises, I'll
switch to some kind of semi-official release system later.

3. Running Owlcat

  Add the resulting Owlcat directory to your PYTHONPATH and PATH.

  Currently, the most useful script in Owlcat is plot-ms.py. See 

    http://www.astron.nl/meqwiki-data/users/oms/Owlcat-plotms-tutorial.purrlog/

  for examples. If you need quick deterministic flagging, try flag-ms.py.

Have fun,
